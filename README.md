## 🕹️ How to Play

### Singleplayer

One player faces away from the screen and the other player clicks the _GENERATE_ button to generate a random spanish-english word combo.

The player facing the screen should then say the english word out loud while the player facing away says the spanish translation and tries to spell it.

It is best to use a timer and see how many words you can translate and spell correctly in 1 minute!

### Multiplayer

Cover the side of the screen that shows the word in spanish.

Click the _GENERATE_ word to generate a random spanish-english word combo.

Translate the english word into spanish and spell the word.

Uncover the spanish word and check if you got it correct!

Soon you will be an expert at spelling spanish words!
