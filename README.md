# Spanish Spelling Bee #

## Description ##

This is a multiplayer game where one person reads the word in english and the other player has to face the other way and spell the word in spanish. This game is a test of concentration, speed, memory and translation ability.

## How to Play ##

To play with someone else, your opponent will either have to run this game on their device or print the Pirate Game on a piece of paper (that is what I did).

Once you click through the title screen, you can click the *PLAY* button in the menu to start the game.

Click *GENERATE* and tell your opponent the coordinate generated.

Keep generating coordinates until you receive an item.

When you receive an item, a message at the bottom will tell you what you can do with the item.
(A full list of all items is shown below this section)

The person with the most points at the end of the game *WINS*!
