# Spanish Spelling Bee #

## Description ##

This is a single/multiplayer game used to improve the player's ability to translate and spell spanish words. This game is a test of concentration, speed, memory and translation ability.

## Singleplayer ##

One player faces away from the screen and the other player clicks the *GENERATE* button to generate a random spanish-english word combo.
